So i have programer background, but i was interested in football. I have become a player in yemen ,Iraq ,luxembourg and Germany. During this year i was looking for a job but there were only the factories i decided to try and had a hard working and very tired job, So i decided to look for the past and used my university degree. The beginning was difficult because there were many languages and framworking there were many opinions of programmers. I searched for 3 months and tried a lot. During the past five months i learned (HTML & CSS -bootstrap) some of (javascript- react - node) some of  (php) some of (python -django),I have tried these things to konw what i love and what i want ... <span>Thank You</span>
